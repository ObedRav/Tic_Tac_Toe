# Flutter Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Flutter Tic-Tac-Toe game project that allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game includes a timer and keeps track of scores for Player X and Player O.

## Features

- Two-player mode (Player X and Player O).
- Timer with a 30-second countdown for each turn.
- Score tracking for Player X and Player O.
- A result declaration when a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Tic-Tac-Toe game up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```shell
  cd flutter-tic-tac-toe
  ```
3. Run the Flutter app:
  ```shell
  flutter run
  ```

The Tic-Tac-Toe game should now be running on your device or emulator.

## How to Play
- Player X starts the game.
- Players take turns tapping on the empty cells to place their mark (`X`or `O`).
- The game continues until one player wins by getting three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until all cells are filled and the game ends in a draw.
- The timer counts down from 30 seconds for each turn. If a player does not make a move within the time limit, the game moves to the next player's turn automatically.
